# Robotics Kinematics and Dynamics


This repository has all the code that is required  to study robotics kinematics and dynamics. I am trying to implement all the theotical knowledge that I have gained  from  subject Advanced Robotics Kinematics and Dynamics that is being taught in RWTH Aachen.


## Roadmap

- Frame Transformation

- Link Kinematics
- Forward Kinematics



## Lessons Learned

- The best thing that I have learnt the practical implementation of OOPs. I have used the different concepts of OOps like inheritance, private variable, class methods, encaplustion and so many.

- Matplotlib usuage for visualization
- How to write the unit test cases


## Reference

I have referred the following videos for implementating the theoretical knowledge into the codebase.
